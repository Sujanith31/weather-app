# WeatherApp Component Documentation
 
## Overview
The WeatherApp component is designed to fetch and display current and daily weather data for a specified location. It leverages several libraries and tools to achieve this functionality, including axios for making HTTP requests and react-toastify for displaying error notifications. The component is styled using Tailwind CSS and includes various weather icons for visual representation of weather conditions.

## Key Functions

### handleSearch:
Triggered when the user clicks the "Search" button.
Fetches the geographic coordinates of the location based on the search query using an external geocoding API.
Updates the state with the fetched coordinates and location name.

### getWeatherImage:
Takes a weather code as input and returns the corresponding weather icon.
Maps weather codes to appropriate images, ensuring a visual representation of the weather condition.

### getBackgroundColor:
Determines the background color class based on the weather code.
Provides a dynamic and visually appealing background that changes according to the weather conditions.

### useEffect Hook
Fetches weather data whenever the latitude and longitude state variables change.
Utilizes the axios library to make an API request to a weather service, fetching current and daily weather data.
Updates the state variables with the fetched data and handles loading and error states.

## JSX Structure

### Search Bar:
Includes an input field and a search button.
Allows users to input a location and trigger a search for weather data.

Includes high and low temperatures, maximum wind speed, and weather icons for each day.


## Component Flow

### User Input:
The user inputs a location in the search bar and clicks the "Search" button.
The handleSearch function is triggered, fetching the geographic coordinates for the entered location.

### Fetching Weather Data:
The useEffect hook listens for changes in latitude and longitude.
When coordinates are updated, it triggers an API call to fetch the weather data.
The fetched data is stored in the weatherData state variable.

### Displaying Data:
If data is loading, a loading message is displayed.
If an error occurs, an error message is shown.
When data is successfully fetched, the current weather and daily forecast are displayed with appropriate icons and background colors.
